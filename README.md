# Masters Thesis - Microbe Detection Using Deep Learning


The goal of this work is to find a method that will be able to find a compressed signal representation for a given microbial DNA fragment. The compressed representation should contain the most important features of the fragment, so that different microbial species can be distinguished according to their representations. The end goal is to be able to cluster different DNA fragment signals according to their species and therefore be able to easily classify a new, unseen and unknown DNA fragment. If the method is good enough, the compressed representations could be used for different purposes as they would contain the most important information from the genome, while being easier to work with because of their reduced dimensionality.
